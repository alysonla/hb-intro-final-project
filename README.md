# Hackbright Intro Final Project

Guess a GitHubber!
This a fun little game which uses [this](https://github.com/about/team.txt) txt file.

The program randomly picks a GitHubber. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to guess where this GitHubber lives.

## To run:

* Open terminal - on mac use spotlight search - command + spacebar & type "terminal" & enter
* Clone the project to your computer
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alysonla/hb-intro-final-project.git
```
* cd into the project folder
```bash
$ cd hb-intro-final-project
```
* Type `python guessing_game.py` to start the game
```bash
$ python guessing_game.py
```
* Guess a GitHubber! Enter the number of your location guess
* To play again, press the up arrow & enter

## All pull requests welcome!

### Ideas for additional features
1. If incorrect, print out the GitHubber's site url from team.txt file.
2. Sort out multiples so San Francisco doesn't appear more than once in possible_locations list
3. Allow for option to choose last 20 GitHubbers in list.
